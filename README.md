# Bayesian latent growth models with Stan

A tutorial on how to fit various classes of trajectory models using R and Stan.

Will eventually include the following (mostly overlapping) types of model

- Growth models
- Latent curve analysis
- Growth mixture model
- Group based trajectory model
- Latent class model
- Hierarchical linear model
- Heterogeneous mixed model
