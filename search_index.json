The motivation for this report is being able to fit growth curve models and latent class growth curve models using R (R Core Team 2021) and Stan (???). There are various packages available for fitting growth models, but not necessarily for doing so in the flexible Bayesian way. Canonically, the main package to use in R for this purpose is lcmm (Proust-Lima, Philipps, and Liquet 2017) and the corresponding plugin in Stata is traj (Jones and Nagin 2013).

A latent process mixed model, as presented in the R package lcmm (Proust-Lima, Philipps, and Liquet 2017), is a term used to describe a generalized linear mixed model of the form \\[\\begin{equation} Y_{ij} = H\\left( \\Lambda(t_{ij}) + \\varepsilon_{ij}~;~ \\eta \\right), \\tag{1.1} \\end{equation}\\] where \\(Y_{ij}\\) is the response for subject \\(i\\) at occasion \\(j\\), at time point \\(t_{ij}\\) with independent normally-distributed measurement error \\(\\varepsilon_{ij}\\). The function \\(H(\\cdot)\\) represents a link function (parametrised by \\(\\eta\\)) relating the response to the linear mixed model latent process given by \\[\\begin{equation} \\Lambda(t) = X(t) \\beta + Z(t) u_i, \\tag{1.2} \\end{equation}\\] for covariate vectors \\(Z(t) \\subset X(t)\\), fixed effects \\(\\beta\\) and random effects \\(u_i\\). The link function \\(H\\) may be linear, and in the case of an identity link, the latent process reduces to a linear mixed model. Else it may represent a distribution function or quadratic L-spline basis. Psychology texts might refer to the same idea by the name latent curve analysis. Within the structural equation modelling framework, Equation (1.2) describes the structural model, while Equation (1.1) is called the measurement model. A mixture of such models is named a latent class mixed model, growth mixture model, group-based trajectory model, heterogeneous mixed model or mixed mixture model, depending on the correlation structure of the random effects. The class or cluster of subject \\(i\\) is denoted by a latent discrete random variable \\(c_i\\) and follows a multinomial logistic model (possibly with covariates predicting class membership). Then for each subject \\(i\\), the model (1.1) is conditional on the class, with fixed effects of covariates may be either common over the classes or class-specific, and random effects that are class specific. See the lcmm::hlme() vignette for examples. The package lcmm supports (via the hlme and lcmm functions) random effects that have either common or heterogeneous (but similarly structured) covariances (toggled via the nwg argument). Meanwhile R package flexmix allows for varying correlation structure between the latent classes; the differences between the two packages are outlined in detail by Wardenaar (2020 and compared with the proprietary statistical software Mplus). These tools are frequentist, based on maximum likelihood esimation; later we will evaluate Bayesian alternatives that work via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. 1.2 Semantic growth Some authors draw distinctions between growth curve modelling, growth mixture modelling and group-based trajectory modelling (Nagin and Odgers 2010; Nagin 2014) but the differences between these approaches are largely semantic or contextual and essentially the three methods describe the same thing. At worst, the techniques are special cases of one another: e.g. growth curve modelling being a degenerate growth mixture model with one mixture component. The word ‘curve’ or ‘trajectory’ is redundant and ‘group’ is synonymous with a mixture component; these semantic variations undoubtedly confuse more than they help clarify. Growth models are generalized linear models with optional random effects (Rosen 1991). Thus a growth model curve is an example of a multilevel linear model with random coefficients (Steele 2007) and can be fitted using standard software, such as the R package lme4 (Bates et al. 2020). There is nothing particularly essential about repeated measures being longitudinal, either: the variable representing time (or age) may be exchanged for any other continuous predictor. Here we describe only a family of related methods, aiming to distinguish by explicit technical differences rather than arbitrary naming conventions. Every such model can be explained in terms of a hierarchical Bayesian model, aided by the expressive power of the Stan language (???).
