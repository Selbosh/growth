# Introduction {-}

This is a living document, recording my current state of knowledge about growth mixture models (and related classes of models) and how to fit them using R and Stan.

The motivation for this report is being able to fit growth curve models and latent class growth curve models using R [@R-base] and Stan [@R-rstan].
There are various packages available for fitting growth models, but not necessarily for doing so in the flexible Bayesian way.

Canonically, the main package to use in R for this purpose is `lcmm` [@lcmm2017] and the corresponding plugin in Stata is `traj` [@Jones2013].
